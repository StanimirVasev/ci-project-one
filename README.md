# User Experience (UX)

- **Project goals:**

  - The main goal for this project is to develop a responsive website for the full-service digital marketing agency Beyond Borders Marketing, which will help the business highlight it's offerings and attract potential clients who want to expand their businesses via digital solutions.

- **Business goals:**

  - The primary business goal is to attract new users to their new easy-to-use website, build their trust through quality content and trustworthy testimonials, and generate warm leads for the sales team to convert over the phone.

- **Customer goals:**

  - The main reason why customers would land on this website is due to the fact that they're struggling to expand their business internationally and/or find new customers in their local markets. Here is where Beyond Borders Marketing comes in as the perfect solution as it offers full-service digital solutions and the client wouldn't need to worry about digital marketing or using multiple agencies that work in silos.

  - **User stories:**

    - First time visitors will be able to:

      - Quickly scan the home page to understand the unique value proposition, service offerings and find relevant testimonials from past clients to remove any concerns.
      - Seamlessly navigate between the various sections on the website to find out more information about each service offering.
      - Easily find contact information and get in touch via a contact form if they prefer online communications.
      - Easily find the business location and social media platforms.

    - Returning visitors will be able to:
      - Browse latest blogs to help them understand the latest developments of SEO, CRO or PPC marketing free of charge.
      - Revisit the information about specific services Beyond Borders Marketing offers before they make a purchase decision. As B2B customers' sales cycle tends to be longer, the website will highlight various content types such as blog posts, podcasts, reports to appeal to audiences that vary in their consumption of content.

# Design choices

- **Images/videos used:**

  - The hero image was created in Canva by the developer and was specifically designed to highlight digital solutions and data graphs as it's related to SEO, CRO and PPC.
  - The services images were created in Canva by the developer and illustrate the different services. Each illustration explains the specific offering. This makes it easier for users to understand what the offering is about without reading any of the text. As users' attention is getting smaller and more difficult to win in recent years, the images are simplyfing the journey for people who tend to skim through content quickly.
  - The location.mp4 video was created in Canva by the developer with the intent to highlight the fact that Beyond Borders Marketing is a digital marketing agency which caters to a global audience (to be exact, it covers over 5 continents).
  - Testimonial images were taken from LinkedIn with permission of the people involved.

- **Colours used:**

  - The colour palette (orange, black, white, grey) was chosen by the developer as it conveys a modern and bold aesthetic while ensuring high readability and contrast, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **Typography:**
  - Two fonts were used throughout this website: Montserrat and Lato. Both were imported by Google Fonts. The selection of Montserrat and Lato was made because they are known for their versatility and compatibility, making them a perfect pair for this website. Montserrat's clean lines and geometric shapes complement Lato's rounded, humanist letterforms, creating a balanced and visually appealing combination that contributes to a cohesive and modern aesthetic across the website.

# Features

### Existing features

- **F02 Masthead section:** The masthead includes text that speaks directly to the user's main painpoint and a call-to-action button that makes it easy for people to get in touch with the company. The button changes once hovered onto to improve user experience. On the right side, it includes an image that illustrates digital solutions in the brand's colours to match the design of the website.

It includes 5 mandatory fields to fill before the message can be submitted which will help the agency to identify those people and store in their CRM platform. Those fields include placeholder text to make it easier on the user to understand what to input on there. The call-to-action button also changes once hovered onto to improve user experience.

- [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): ![CSS validator results](assets/images/css-validator.png)

### Manual testing

- I have rigorously tested the website's responsiveness using Chrome Developer Tools. The website seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices. While it excels on desktop, it also delivers a great performance on mobile and tablet screens.

### Lighthouse

- I utilised Lighthouse within Chrome Developer Tools to comprehensively analyse various aspects of my website, including SEO, accessibility, performance, and best practices. The results from these tests ensure that my website meets high-quality standards across the board. You can find the results below:

### Known Bugs

- When hovering onto each individual service offering from the Services section on the navbar, the background colour doesn't align with the dividers.

- Missing blog, SEO, CRO, PPC individual pages.

- Submit a message call-to-action button at the bottom of the Get in touch section isn't functional as it requires server-side script to receive the data once submitted and process it.
- The location.mp4 video flickers once you scroll on the page but works perfectly once standing still on the page. I couldn't figure out how to fix this.
